# SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTUON 
This repository provides an overview of essential practices and principles in software 
construction, focusing on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and SOLID principles. Software construction is a crucial phase in the SDLC, involving the detailed creation of working, meaningful software through a combination of coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The SDLC aims to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates, and is efficient and defect-free. The SDLC involves several distinct stages, including:

- **Planning**: Identifying the scope and defining the project plan.
- **Analysis and Requirements Gathering**: Understanding and documenting what the software must do.
- **Design**: Defining how the software will work and what it will look like.
- **Implementation (Construction)**: The actual writing of program code.
- **Testing**: Verifying that the software works as intended.
- **Deployment**: Releasing the software to users.
- **Maintenance**: Updating and fixing software as needed post-deployment.

## SOLID Principles
The SOLID principles are a set of design principles for object-oriented software development intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility. This principle helps to ensure that classes are focused and do not become overly complex or difficult to maintain.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle encourages developers to design software components that can be easily extended without modifying existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle helps to ensure that subclasses adhere to the same contract as their superclass, preventing unexpected behavior or errors.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle encourages developers to create small, focused interfaces that are specific to the needs of clients, reducing the risk of unnecessary dependencies and making software more maintainable.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
